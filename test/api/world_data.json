The blast, which occurred on Saturday, is believed to have been caused by improperly stored chemical materials at the port facility, with fires continuing to burn more than 24 hours after the initial explosion.",

                "Ongoing response: Helicopters and aircraft have been dumping water from the air as firefighters continue battling blazes more than 24 hours after the explosion.",
                "Impact radius: The explosion was so powerful that it was felt and heard up to 50 kilometers away, shattering windows throughout the surrounding area.",
                "Possible causes: While officials suspect poorly stored chemicals, some reports suggest the explosion may have involved sodium perchlorate, a component used in solid fuel for missiles.",
                "Relief efforts: Of the approximately 1,000 injured people, about two-thirds have been discharged from medical centers while others continue receiving treatment.",
                "Economic impact: Port authorities have resumed some operations in unaffected areas of the port, though the facility remains partially crippled."
